This repository consists of the simulink app that I made with my team member Nihar Shah during the course of Signal Systems and Random Processes by Nitin V. George at IIT Gandhinagar. This repo. consists of two applications one for the child and one for the parents. The two applications are interconnected and the data captured from the child app is send to the parent app. If the child overspeeds, gets out of the assigned boundary, or falls from the bicycle, a warning is send to the parents app indicating the same. Also a buzzer starts to beep in child app so that he/she gets notified if they are overspeeding or out of the boundary set by the parents.
